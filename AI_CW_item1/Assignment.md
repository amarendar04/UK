**Notes and Advice**

```
⚫ The Extenuating Circumstances procedure is there to support you if you have had any
circumstances (problems) that have been serious or significant enough to prevent you from
attending, completing or submitting an assessment on time. If you complete an Extenuating
Circumstances Form (ECF) for this assessment, it is important that you use the correct
module code, item number and deadline (not the late deadline) given above.
⚫ ASDAC are available to any students who disclose a disability or require additional support
for their academic studies with a good set of resources on the ASDAC moodle site
⚫ The University takes any form of academic misconduct (such as plagiarism or cheating)
seriously, so please make sure your work is your own. Please ensure you adhere to our
Student Conduct Policy and watch the video on Plagiarism.
⚫ Any material included in your coursework should be fully cited and referenced in APA 7
format. Detailed advice on referencing is available from the library, also see TECFAC 08
Plagiarism.
⚫ Any material submitted that does not meet format or submission guidelines, or falls outside of
the submission deadline could be subject to a cap on your overall result or disqualification
entirely.
⚫ If you need additional assistance, you can ask your personal tutor, student engagement
officer ana.baker@port.ac.uk, academic tutor eleni.noussi@port.ac.uk or your lecturers.

# AI Statement

```
AI tools, including Generative AI, should not be used to :
```
- generate content to include in your assessment submission
- generate code to include in your assessment submission

```
AI tools, including Generative AI, can be used to :
```
- develop your understanding of the concepts covered in the module
- practice use of analytics and programming skills
- check/improve the clarity of your language

```
Use AI tools critically. They make mistakes and their language is not precise. For
example, accuracy and precision may be used as synonyms, while in machine
learning these are metrics with very specific meaning and using them
interchangeably is not appropriate.
```
# Coursework 1

```
Please only use your ID anywhere on the coursework or the cover sheet.
Heart attacks are a serious condition and a life-threatening emergency.
Artificial Intelligence can help predict heart attacks and save lives. We are
looking for an AI-based model to predict the heart attack given some health
indicators such as BMI, age, being a smoker, with high accuracy.
Please write a report in 1500 words explaining in detail different stages of
achieving the goal of this project. The report should include the following
steps in detail. The dataset has been provided for you on Moodle (50%).
```
```
[20%] 1 .1. Prepare the dataset for training (Check for missing values, splitting
the dataset in training and testing datasets...)
[20%] 1 .2. Choose and tailor 4 Models you have learnt during lectures
including an ANN-based model and train and build the models.
[20%] 1. 3. Evaluate your model using metrics you have learnt during the
lectures.
[20%] 1. 4. Compare the models and report the most accurate model for this
purpose.
[20%] 1. 5. Please provide 2 ways (with evidence) to further improve the
accuracy of your best model.
```
```
Grading Criteria
The grading criteria (in 100% breakup of marks) is as follows:
```

60% - Thorough analysis and evaluation of results.

20% - Use of tables and figures when reporting the results.

10% - Concise and clear organization and presentation of findings, clear
language and

writing style.

10% -Provide ways of further improving the accuracy of your developed
models

**Deliverables**

Please submit the followings on Moodle in the designated folder (Coursework
submission folder):

1. A final report in PDF format with 1500 words excluding figures and tables.
2. The source codes (. ipynb files).
