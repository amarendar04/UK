Sure — I will **extract the meaning**, **interpret the structure**, and rewrite the PDF content as **clear, human-readable text** (not raw tables or direct conversion).
Here is a fully simplified, readable explanation of the entire marking template.

# **Clean & Understandable Summary of the Marking Template (IDTA Coursework 1 – 2025/26)**

This document is a **marking rubric** describing how your coursework will be graded.
The total mark is **100**, divided into **5 tasks**, each worth **20%**.

For every task, marks are broken into three components:

1. **Analysis of Results – 65% of the task’s marks**
2. **Use of Tables & Figures – 20% of the task’s marks**
3. **Structure & Presentation – 15% of the task’s marks**

Every component has detailed descriptions of what earns low, medium, or high marks.

# **Task 1 – Descriptive Analytics (20%)**

### **Task 1a – Display & interpret basic statistics for all 11 attributes (10%)**

To score well:

* You must show results for **all 11 attributes**.
* Interpret the statistics correctly (not just show them).
* Use clear tables/figures.
* Organise the section well.

**Failing or low marks:**

* No results displayed
* Results for only a few attributes (e.g., 1–3)
* Missing or unclear tables/figures
* Poor structure

**High marks:**

* Statistics for all attributes
* Correct interpretation
* Clear tables/figures with strong insights
* Very good or excellent organisation
* Additional insights beyond requirements score even higher

---

### **Task 1b – Create & interpret 5 visualisation graphs (10%)**

(1 boxplot + 4 relationship visualisations)

To score well:

* Provide all **5 correct visualisations**
* Provide correct interpretation for every graph
* Clear tables/figures
* Well-written section

**Low marks:**

* 1–2 visualisations
* Missing or incorrect interpretations
* Poor structure
* Unclear graphics

**High marks:**

* All 5 graphs present and correctly interpreted
* Clear visuals
* Additional insights score higher
* Excellent structure and clarity

---

# **Task 2 – Classification using 3 algorithms (20%)**

You must:

* Run **3 classification algorithms**
* Present overall and per-class results (accuracy, precision, recall etc.)
* Compare the algorithms
* Interpret the results

**Low marks:**

* No results
* Results for only 1 algorithm
* Incorrect/absent analysis
* No comparison
* Poor clarity or missing tables/figures

**Medium marks:**

* Results for 2 algorithms
* Some analysis, but incomplete comparison
* Some unclear visual outputs

**High marks:**

* Results for all 3 algorithms
* Correct per-class and overall interpretation
* Correct comparison
* Well-structured explanation
* Additional insights/extra results score highest

---

# **Task 3 – Regression on “Number of Hours” using 2 algorithms (20%)**

You must:

* Run **2 regression algorithms**
* Present performance metrics (Error, R², or both)
* Compare the algorithms
* Interpret findings

**Low marks:**

* No or irrelevant results
* Only 1 algorithm evaluated
* Incorrect or missing comparison
* Unclear or missing visuals

**Medium marks:**

* Correct analysis for 1 algorithm
* Partially correct comparison
* Some clear tables/figures

**High marks:**

* Correct analysis for both algorithms
* Correct comparison
* If you interpret both **Error AND R²**, you get higher marks
* Additional insights score highest
* Clear organisation and strong visuals

---

# **Task 4 – Association Rule Mining (20%)**

You must:

* Use **one rule-mining algorithm**
* Interpret **at least 5 rules**
* Explain what each rule means and why it matters
* Present tables/figures clearly

**Low marks:**

* Fewer than 5 rules interpreted
* Incorrect or missing interpretation for many rules
* Poor organisation
* Unclear visuals

**Medium marks:**

* Correct interpretation for 3–4 rules
* Mostly clear tables/figures
* Adequate organisation

**High marks:**

* Correct interpretation for all 5 rules
* Additional insights beyond simple explanation
* Excellent structure & clarity
* Clear tables/figures
* Extra insights score highest

---

# **Task 5 – Clustering using 2 algorithms (20%)**

You must:

* Perform clustering with **2 algorithms**
* Provide cluster descriptions (values per cluster, coverage, etc.)
* Compare the results
* Use tables & figures

**Low marks:**

* Results missing or incomplete
* Only 1 algorithm analysed
* Incorrect or missing comparison
* Poor organisation or unclear tables

**Medium marks:**

* Partial results for 1 algorithm
* Some correct analysis
* Partially correct comparison
* Some clarity issues

**High marks:**

* Correct analysis for both algorithms
* Correct comparison
* Clear visualisations
* Good cluster interpretation (coverage + values)
* Additional insights score highest
* Very good/excellent organisation

# **Adjustments**

The rubric includes a *small adjustment range* from **–5 to +5**, applied based on exceptional deficiencies or exceptional strengths.

---

# **General Notes**

* Late submissions without valid ECF are **capped at 40**.
* Marks are moderated by the university board.
