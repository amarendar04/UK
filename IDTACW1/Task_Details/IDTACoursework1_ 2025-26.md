**Notes and Advice**

- The Extenuating Circumstances procedure is there to support you if you have had any
    circumstances (problems) that have been serious or significant enough to prevent you from
    attending, completing or submitting an assessment on time. If you complete an Extenuating
    Circumstances Form (ECF) for this assessment, it is important that you use the correct module
    code, item number and deadline (not the late deadline) given above.
- ASDAC are available to any students who disclose a disability or require additional support for their
    academic studies with a good set of resources on the ASDAC moodle site


- The University takes any form of academic misconduct (such as plagiarism or cheating) seriously,
    so please make sure your work is your own. Please ensure you adhere to our _Student Conduct_
    _Policy_ and watch the video on Plagiarism.
- Any material included in your coursework should be fully cited and referenced in **APA 7**
    format. Detailed advice on referencing is available from the library, also see TECFAC 08
    Plagiarism.
- Any material submitted that does not meet format or submission guidelines, or falls outside of the
    submission deadline could be subject to a cap on your overall result or disqualification entirely.
- If you need additional assistance, you can ask your personal tutor, student engagement
    officer ana.baker@port.ac.uk, academic tutor eleni.noussi@port.ac.uk or your lecturers.
- If you are concerned about your mental well-being, please contact our Well-being service

## AI Statement

AI tools, including Generative AI, **should not be used to** :

- generate content to include in your assessment submission
- generate code to include in your assessment submission

AI tools, including Generative AI, **can be used to** :

- develop your understanding of the concepts covered in the module
- practice use of analytics and programming skills
- check/improve the clarity of your language

**Use AI tools critically**. They make mistakes and their language is not precise. For example,
accuracy and precision may be used as synonyms, while in machine learning these are metrics
with very specific meaning and using them interchangeably is not appropriate.


# Intelligent Data and Text Analytics Coursework 1

Download the “Depression Professional Dataset” from the IDTA module page on Moodle.

1. **[ 2 0%]** Descriptive analytics:
    a. [10%] Display and interpret basic statistics for _all attributes_
    b. [10%] Display and interpret _5 visualisation_ graphs; include one box plot and four
       visualisations that show relationships between 2 or more variables
2. **[ 2 0%]** Perform _classification_ for the “Depression” attribute using 3 algorithms; explain the
    data preparation and model development; present and discuss the results; compare the
    results of the 3 algorithms.
3. **[20%]** Perform _regression_ on the “Age” attribute using 2 algorithms; explain the data
    preparation and model development; present and discuss the results; compare the results of
    the 2 algorithms.
4. **[20%]** Prepare data and perform _Association Rule Mining_ using 1 algorithm and interpret the
    meaning of at least 5 rules.
5. **[20%]** Perform _clustering_ using 2 algorithms; Explain the data preparation and model
    development; present and discuss the results; compare the results of the 2 algorithms.

**The marking scheme** [in 100% breakup of marks] **for each of the tasks is as follows:**

⁂ **65% - Analysis of the results of the experiments you have conducted**

- Include important findings.
- Critically evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the methods/algorithms
    /parameters selected.
- Discuss the effect and impact of the methods/algorithms/parameters used, justifying your
    approach and methods.
- Base your conclusions on critical analysis and the insights you have gained throughout the
    module.

⁂ **20% - Appropriate use of tables and figures when reporting the results**

- Include clear, informative titles.
- Provide meaningful and concise visualisations.
- Present information using the appropriate visualisations.
- Pay attention to consistency between values or details in a table/figure.
- Use labels and legends to ensure your figures are clear


⁂ **15% - Structure and presentation**

- Organise your report so it is clear and easy to read, using sections and subsections as
    appropriate.
- Pay attention to the quality of your prose, including the use and flow of language, grammar,
    spelling, and format.
- Use graphics and tables as appropriate (clear and readable) and choose a page layout that is
    easy to follow and understand.

### Deliverables – to be submitted through Moodle/Wiseflow:

1. A **pdf** report documenting all tasks:
    - the report should include up to **3 000 words overall** , excluding tables and figures;
    - **be concise** – do not include general information, such as an overview of a technique
       or algorithm – include just the relevant information about applying techniques/
       algorithms on the data, the results and their interpretation;
    - **_as a guideline_** use approximately 600 words per task; make use of tables and figures,
       as these do not count towards the word count;
    - **_there is no hard requirement of words per task_** – some may be longer than others;
       the only hard requirement is the total of 3 000 words overall.
2. A zip file with Python code (and/or equivalent from other software).

### IMPORTANT NOTE

- You may complete the coursework **individually, OR in pairs, OR in groups of three.**
- Any unacknowledged copying of either printed material or software from any other
    person or source (including electronic media) constitutes **plagiarism** , which is a serious
    disciplinary offence; any cases of plagiarism will be handled using the University
    disciplinary procedures.
- Please ensure that your coursework is anonymous. Your **NAME must not appear**
    anywhere on the coursework or the coversheet. Please **use your ID only**.

## Deadline: Monday 24 November 2025 , 13:


### Important Information About Group Formation:

- Team members **must belong to the same class group** (Group 1 on Mondays, Group 2 on
    Fridays).
- You **must define your group on Moodle** , even if you plan to complete the coursework
    _individually_ (a group with one member).
- Once you have agreed with your teammates, create your group and **record all members’**
    **names** on Moodle.
- If you choose to work in a group, **you cannot later switch to individual work** , and the same
    applies if you start individually, you cannot switch to a group.
- If you choose to complete the coursework as a group, you **must include an appendix** in
    your report clearly outlining **each member’s individual contributions**. This ensures
    transparency and fair assessment.
- By default, it is assumed that **all team members contribute equally** and thus receive the
    same mark. However, if the lecturer determines that contributions were unequal,
    **individual marks may differ accordingly**.
- The **deadline to form your teams** for the **first coursework** is **31 October 2025 , 13:**.
